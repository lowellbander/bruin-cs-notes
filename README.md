# bruin-cs-notes

The intent of this repository is to build up a collection of notes for CS classes at UCLA, with the hope that it will both:

1. Create a community that has a more addititive approach to learning. That is, your learning experience ought to be strictly better than the learning experience of someone who took the class previously, because the students in that previous class improved upon the knowledge base.
2. Teach folks how to contribute to open source projects.
